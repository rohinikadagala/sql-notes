SQL language is introduced in the year of 1970's by E.F.Codd,in IBM

	--> to inserting the data into database
	--> to retreive the data from the database
	--> to peform the update and delete opertations
	--> to create indexs,views,procedures,....
note:
-----
simply by using SQL to perform CURD/CRUD operations.

SQL is a case-insensitive language.

Basic SQL Commands:
--------------------
Data Definition Languages(DDL):
---------------------------------
	these commands are used to define the database structure,table structure,apply some changes in our tables.

	these commands are auto commited statements

	Create,Alter(add,modify,rename,drop), Drop,Rename,Truncate.

	These commands are used to retreive the data from the database.

	Select command is a DRL/DQL command

Data Control Languages(DCL):
----------------------------
	These commands are used to perform the Admin Level operations like giveing the permessions to the users and remove the permissions from the user.

	Grant and Revoke

Transaction Control Languages(TCL):
-------------------------------------
